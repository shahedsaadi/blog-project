### Overview

Personal blog or personal diary website. The home page includes all of the blog posts listed in chronological order, but the actual blog content will be truncated to only 100 characters. When the user clicks on read more it will go to an individual page of each one of the blog posts and read them independently on a single page. There's also a hidden page that will allow composing the diary, so if created a new post and hit publish then it appears on the home page and a brand new page has been created for that new post.
